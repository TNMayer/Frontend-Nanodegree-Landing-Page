## Description

This project is part of a Udacity Nanodegree Program in frontend webdevelopment I am currently taking. The goal is to dynamically change the appearance of an html-file using Java Script. In particular:
* A navigation is created based on the sections in the html-file
* The active State of the section and the navigation bar is toggled automatically based on the content active in the viewport.
